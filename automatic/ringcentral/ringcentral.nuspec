<![CDATA[
RingCentral RingEX is a modern, cloud-based unified communications and collaboration platform for businesses that combines all essential communication tools into a single app.

It brings together voice calls, video meetings, team messaging, SMS/text, and even fax with deep integration into business tools like Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft Teams to streamline how teams and organizations communicate and collaborate

This package is installing the version [RingCentral App for IT (Non-Auto Update)](https://support.ringcentral.com/download.html) which does not automatically updates itself, it was chosen as this grants more control over the package and avoids potentially broken auto-updater and its vulnerabilities.
